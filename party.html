          <h1>Wedding Party</h1>

          <h2>Bridal Party</h2>
          
          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/ez.jpg" /><div class="afterparty"></div>Elizabeth Zagroba</h4>
          <p>Catherine&#39;s older sister. She famously moonwalked across the stage to receive her college diploma and will no doubt break out her moves at the reception. She lives in Brooklyn, works as a software tester, and made this website!</p>
          </div>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/md.jpg" /><div class="afterparty"></div>Margaret Doran</h4>
          <p>Catherine&#39;s oldest sister and constant cooking/baking inspiration. The adorable flower girls and ring bearers all belong to her. Maggie lives in South Bend, Indiana, with her husband, Kirk, and homeschools her children.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/ta.jpg" /><div class="afterparty"></div>Tori Angelini</h4>
          <p>Catherine&#39;s oldest friend and swimming teammate growing up. Tori recently moved back to the New York area with her husband Matt. She continues to impress everyone with her woodworking and home improvement skills, making up for Catherine&#39;s extreme lack of artistic ability.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/tm.jpg" /><div class="afterparty"></div>Tory Mather</h4>
          <p>Catherine&#39;s other friend named Tory. Catherine and Tory met in middle school, a time of their life which Tory remembers clearly and Catherine thankfully does not. These days Tory is always picking up new endurance sports and competing in (read: winning) races.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/eb.jpg" /><div class="afterparty"></div>Emily Barr</h4>
          <p>A friend from Ridgewood who spent most of high school in classes with Catherine. After college, Emily and Catherine were roommates in Boston for a few years (pre-Brent). Emily works at an education non-profit in Boston and can often be found curled up with a good book.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/jm.jpg" /><div class="afterparty"></div>Jessica Marchesani</h4>
          <p>A friend from Ridgewood who now lives in New Hampshire with her wife Anna. Jessica is always up to try local breweries and cideries (which quickly won over Brent).  She helps people recover from injury as a Recreation Therapist at a rehabilitation hospital.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/mf.jpg" /><div class="afterparty"></div>Margaret Fish</h4>
          <p>Catherine&#39;s Harvard teammate and college roommate who shares Catherine&#39;s love of long meals and naps. She recently wrapped up her PhD in Chemical Engineering at the University of Michigan. This fall, she got married and started as a scientist at AbbVie in Chicago.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/as.jpg" /><div class="afterparty"></div>Alexandra Sopko</h4>
          <p>Catherine&#39;s college roommate and life cheerleader. She is pint-sized, and as a coxswain for the men&#39;s crew team, is often hilariously surrounded by large men. She works at a social impact consulting firm in DC and always has fun facts at the ready.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/fm.jpg" /><div class="afterparty"></div>Faith Martin</h4>
          <p>Catherine&#39;s Harvard teammate. Faith lives in Boston and works at a marketing firm. Not much has changed since college (other than much less swimming). Catherine and Faith can still be found regularly taking selfies, reliving hilarious events, and frequenting Border Cafe, a Harvard square favorite.</p>
          </div>

          <br/><br/>

          <h2>Groom&#39;s Party</h2>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/sheree.jpg" /><div class="afterparty">Sheree Muller</h4>
          <p>Sheree is Brent&#39;s younger sister, and she inherited all the artistic talent: she&#39;s a self-taught guitar player, singer, and painter. Sheree is soon to graduate from Cal Poly, where she has studied the impact of climate change on the ocean &#45; bringing her one step closer to fulfilling her dream of living on her surfboard.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/andrew.jpg" /><div class="afterparty">Andrew Dunckel</h4>
          <p>Andrew and Brent have been friends since elementary school. Over the past 20 years, they&#39;ve explored California on many backpacking trips, hunted with their dads, and even spent a summer in Hawai&#39;i &#34;studying for the SAT.  &#34; Andrew works as a database developer in California.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/rich.jpg" /><div class="afterparty">Rich Mazzuto</h4>
          <p>Rich and Brent were roommates during their first year at Yale. During that year, Rich introduced Brent to Guitar Hero, Seinfeld, and Family Guy, which was bad for their studies but great for their friendship. Rich works for Disney in New York as a project manager.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/bryce.jpg" /><div class="afterparty">Bryce Taylor</h4>
          <p>Bryce was one of Brent&#39;s college roommates and his ping pong nemesis. He recently hiked the entire Appalachian Trail and grew a beard that even Brent envied. Bryce is currently writing and directing his first movie. In his spare time, he works as a software consultant in Texas.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/gabe.jpg" /><div class="afterparty">Gabriel Ellsworth</h4>
          <p>Gabe was another of Brent&#39;s college roommates and a frequent Mario Kart competitor. He now lives in Boston and works as at Harvard Business School, where he writes cases for MBA students like Brent and Catherine. As at Yale, Gabe can still be found around campus wearing a bow tie and humming classical music.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/sarah.jpg" /><div class="afterparty">Sarah Ballatori</h4>
          <p>Sarah and Brent became fast friends in college over a love of science and terrible Chinese food. After college, they were roommates, where they introduced Catherine and Sarah&#39;s wife Jess to Brookline's version of terrible Chinese food: Chef Chow&#39;s. Sarah is in her third year of medical school at Tufts.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/cassie.jpg" /><div class="afterparty">Cassie Trujillo</h4>
          <p>Cassie and Brent became friends at Yale over long meals in the Silliman dining hall. Cassie moved to Boston for grad school and now works at a non-profit. Cassie, Catherine, and Brent have shared many scoops of ice cream (or in Cassie's case, sorbet) at JP Licks, one of the couple&#39;s favorite Boston establishments.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="preparty">
          <h4><img class="party" src="images/km.jpg" /><div class="afterparty"></div>Kyle McElroy</h4>
          <p>Kyle grew up swimming with Catherine and then met Brent at Yale, where they lived in the same dorm. He received his PhD in Biology at Harvard (much to Catherine&#39;s delight) and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Tufts. He has an uncanny ability to pick up new board games and frequently joins Catherine and Brent to play.</p>
